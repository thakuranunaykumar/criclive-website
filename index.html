            <h1>India vs Australia, 4th Test Match Details:</h1>
        <p style="font-size: large ;">India will take on Australia in the fourth and final Test match of the four-match series at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. The Rohit Sharma-led side suffered a rare defeat in the previous game after Australian spinners outbowled the hosts.</p>
        <p style="font-size: large ;">India need a win to ensure a place in the World Test Championship final as a defeat would mean that they would have to rely on other results go in their favour.</p>
       <br> <p><b>Time:</b> The fourth Test match between India and Australia is scheduled to start at 9:30 AM IST.</p>
        <p><b>Venue:</b> India vs Australia, 4th Test match will be played at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.</p>
        <p><b>Date:</b> India vs Australia fourth Test match will be played on March 9, 2023.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>India vs Australia, 4th Test Match Buildup</h1>
        <p>While Australia have managed to get a rare win over India, the hosts will once again start as favorites in Ahmedabad.

            The first three Test matches have ended inside three days and a similar result is on the cards when the two teams will face each other on Thursday.
            Spinners are again likely to dominate the proceedings but we cannot rule out the fast bowlers as we saw what Umesh Yadav managed to do in Indore.
            </p><br>
            <h1>India vs Australia, 4th Test Weather Report</h1>
            <p>The weather during the duration of the India vs Australia 4th Test match is expected to be very hot, with a maximum temperature of 41 degrees. Rain is likely to stay away during the five days of the Test match. On Day 4 and 5, the conditions will be a bit overcast but we should get uninterrupted action.</p>
    <h1>India vs Australia, 4th Test Cricket Match Pitch Report</h1>
    <p>
        The pitch at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad has favoured the spinners over the years and a similar surface is expected to be used for the fourth Test match between India and Australia, starting March 9.
        However, with the ICC rating the Indore pitch as poor and handing demerit points to the venue, the curators may not prepare a dust bowl and the batters may find it easy to negotiate the bowling on the first couple of days.
    </p>
    <h1>Average Innings Score</h1>
    <p>
        The average first innings score at Narendra Modi Stadium is 338 while the second innings average total in Ahmedabad is 337. The scores go down considerably in the third and fourth innings.
    </p>
    <h1>Top Performing Player</h1>
    <p>
        Ravindra Jadeja from India has been in outstanding form throughout the Test series. He has picked up 21 wickets in three Test matches and has also scored over 100 runs with the bat.
    </p>
    <p>
        For Australia, Nathan Lyon was the star in the Indore Test match as he picked up eight wickets in the second innings to set up a win for the visitors.
    </p>
    <h1>India vs Australia, 4th Test Match Injury Update</h1>
    <p>

        Pat Cummins has been ruled out from the fourth Test as he has decided to stay with his ailing mother at home.


David Warner and Josh Hazlewood have been ruled out of the series as well.
